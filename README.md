# SEED Emulator Demonstration
The above files were used in the SEED Emulator Demonstration.
The **Python files** generate the emulation environments and customize the nodes.
The `rdh` folder contains the communication files during emulation, including the **server-client scripts**, **multicasting scripts**, and the **tcpdump commands**.
