# SEED Emulator Demonstration
The above files were used in the SEED Emulator Demonstration presentation.
The **Python files** generate the emulation environments and customize the nodes.
The `rdh` folder contains the communication files used during emulation, including the **server-client scripts**, **tcpdump commands**, and **multicasting scripts**.
